Day 3 - Puzzle 1

My idea for the solution is to treat the right/down directives as an increment in the index of the each char that
composes the map. This way I do not have to worry about the width of the map.
Since the map may have a different width each time, i first find the idx_interval (so what increment does 3 right/ 1 down mean in relation to the map width)
I then split the map into a list of chars.
Now i simply count which chars appear at the relevant index, moving my cursor by a to_next_idx value.
I save them to a result list and remove the first item manually because i have not figured out yet a better way.

Issue: my solution is wrong and i think the issue resides in the way i am dealing with the IndexError. I feel
like I am missing a few trees that would appear right before that error occurs.
